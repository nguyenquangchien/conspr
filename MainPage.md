# Introduction #

As a beginner, you might want to study the phenomena of contaminant spreading in [natural water bodies](natural_water_body.md). While there are several methods of approaches (field observation, lab work), one of the most popular method is to use a numerical model.


# Structure #
In conspr, the natural water body is divided into non-overlapping [control volumes](control_volume.md).


# Implementation #

conspr is written in [Python](http://python.org). It is quite straightforward to understand and appealing for newcomers. Of course, real-world applications require much more complex models / softwares, however conspr can be used in preliminary analyses as well as for teaching.
