This Python-based software package provides a simple, clear approach to solve and visualize problems related to contaminant spreading in natural water bodies.

The module for hydrodynamic calculation is based on XBeach (http://xbeach.org), which simulates the shallow water flows. Functionalities regarding contaminant loading and decay is added. Output of simulation is the distribution of contaminant within the water body through time.

The front-end is built on PyQt, offering new users a convenient way to input data, tune parameters and observe the result. More experienced users can write code based on the class structure of conspr to exploit the full capability of the program.
